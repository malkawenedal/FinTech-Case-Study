## Case study
## Float inc 


## Overview and Origin

 Float is the first startup of a fintech company in the Canadian market .It offers a  corporate card and spend management solution that allows corporate cards, reimbursements, approvals, and invoices management.
Float was started by Griffin Keglevich and Ruslan Nikolaev, two graduates of 
Waterloo’s computer science and business programs, in 2019.

“After internship placements at Uber and Shopify, Keglevich and Nikolaev realized early on the frustrations around submitting expense reports, company reimbursements, and business cards. Keglevich personally experienced being out of pocket for thousands of dollars for an event he helped a company plan as an intern, and ended up paying on three different personal cards and waiting to get reimbursed.”  
Given this experience, Float was created as a reimbursement-focused company for Canadian small-and-medium businesses (SMBs). With the addition of former Uber Canada general manager Rob Khazzam as CEO, earlier this year, Float has turned its attention towards its corporate card offering” . (migan simpson. 2021).

The seed round consisted of $4 million in equity co-led by( Susa Ventures) and existing investor( Golden Ventures). It also saw participation from Andrew Wilkinson’s Tiny Capital, Michael Litt-led Garage Capital and Global Founders Capital. Silicon Valley Bank provided $1 million in debt as part of the financing.  The total funding amount up to date to around $42 M million according to( crunchbase).

-------------------------
## Landscape:
 After researching the company and looking at their website , blogs and some website like crunchbase, it seems that the company domain is  payment card industry  , within this domain there are alot of major companies that have a large portion of  market- share in the canadian market such as:   BMO , Scotia bank, CIBC ,RBC,.american express . but the major risk of competition will come from those two fintech companies ( jeeves, caary capital ) , which are  offering some features that compete with my company . 




## Results

My company is performing well relative to other competitors , as they just started 2 years ago  and now they have total funding amount of  42 M,invested from some of the big company like tiger global and garage capital 
Recommendations

If i was in a position to advice this company , i would advise them to offer more services and products that other competitor already have such as: 
Providing Travel medical insurance 
Providing  Auto+ home  insurance 
Removing the late payment fees
Removing the cash advance fees 
Using blockchain and cryptocurrencies 


-Offer these services and products will remove any obstacles that would be the reason behind why some companies would stick with their current credit card rather than switch to Float card . so float will be unbeatable and no can offer what they offering
